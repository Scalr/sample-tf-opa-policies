A sample collection of OPA policies to test against Terraform run in Scalr.

* Blog series for getting started with OPA for Terraform in Scalr: https://scalr.com/blog/opa-series-part-1-open-policy-agent-and-terraform/

## Policy Files

Each sample policy comprises 3 files.

- `*.rego`: The OPA policy
- `*.mock.json`: Input data for testing the policy with `opa test`
- `*.test.rego`: Definition of the tests that `opa test` should run and expected results

Each folder also includes an example `scalr-policy.hcl` file. These files are used by Scalr to implement enforcement levels for each policy (`hard-mandatory`, `soft-mandatory`, `advisory`). See [Enabling and Enforcing Policy](https://docs.scalr.com/en/latest/opa.html#enabling-and-enforcing-policy) for more details.

## Policy Evaluation

You can evaluate a policy against your own terraform plans using the Terraform CLI and `opa eval` as follows.

```bash
$ terraform plan --out planfile
$ terraform show -json planfile > plan.json
$ opa eval --format pretty --data policy.rego -i plan.json data.terraform.deny
```

## Policies

Summary descriptions of each policy. Detailed descriptions of each rule can be found as comments in the policy file.
Many policies contain arrays of values that are checked against resources. The arrays and reason messages are of course customisable.

## Contributions

We welcome contributions in many ways!

### Report Bugs

Submit bug reports at https://github.com/Scalr/sample-tf-opa-policies/issues.

Be sure to include the following.

* Link to the policy file.
* The `terraform plan` data in JSON format you tested against.
* The `opa eval` command used to reproduce the problem and it's output.

### Feedback and Suggestions

Submit feed back and suggestions at https://github.com/Scalr/sample-tf-opa-policies/issues.

Be sure to include the following.

* Detailed description of how you expect a policy to work.
* Sample `terraform plan` data the policy should work against.

### Pull Requests

Better still have a go at fixing bug or implementing new policy examples yourself and submit a Pull Request.

If you submit a new policy you must include the following files.

* The `*.rego` file with the policy code.
* `*_mock.json` containing test data mocks. You should include data for both valid and invalid evaluation of each rule in the policy.
* `*_test.rego` defining the tests to be run and expected results when the PR checks are performed.

To submit a PR follow the standard process.

1. Fork the repo
2. Clone locally and create a new branch
3. Commit and push
4. Submit pull request

Before submitting the PR for the new policy or bug fix you should confirm it works using `opa eval` as shown above and validate the mock based tests work using `opa test`.

Example test

```
# opa test enforce_sec_group.* -v
data.terraform.test_valid: PASS (7.390418ms)
data.terraform.test_invalid: PASS (603.837µs)
data.terraform.test_missing: PASS (483.272µs)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PASS: 3/3
```
